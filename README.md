# GO-quiz-game

We can attempt to answer the questions in the command line, and the final result will be shown to you in the end of the game.

We can start the game by running $ go run main.go

In this case the default case i.e the problems.csv file is running. But we can attempth a different set of question and ansers by running the program with another csv file.

We can do that by running the command $go run main.go -filename problems2

in case of problems2 you can add your own csv file and add the name here and run the command and the program will run with that file.
